{"version":"1.3.0","description":"Zowe is an open source project created to host technologies that benefit the Z platform from all members of the Z community (Integrated Software Vendors, System Integrators and z/OS consumers). Zowe, like Mac or Windows, comes with a set of APIs and OS capabilities that applications build on and also includes some applications out of the box. Zowe offers modern interfaces to interact with z/OS and allows you to work with z/OS in a way that is similar to what you experience on cloud platforms today. You can use these interfaces as delivered or through plug-ins and extensions that are created by clients or third-party vendors.","components":[{"name":"Imperative CLI Framework","repository":"imperative","version":"2.4.8"},{"name":"Zowe API Mediation Layer","repository":"api-layer","version":"1.1.5"},{"name":"zowe-common-c(Zowe Application Framework)","repository":"zowe-common-c","version":"zss-v1.3.0"},{"name":"Zowe CLI","repository":"zowe-cli","version":"2.28.2"},{"name":"Zowe CLI Plug-in for IBM CICS","repository":"zowe-cli-cics-plugin","version":"1.0.0"},{"name":"Zowe CLI Plug-in for IBM Db2 Database","repository":"zowe-cli-db2-plugin","version":"2.1.0"},{"name":"Zowe Desktop Data Sets UI Plugin","repository":"explorer-mvs","version":"0.0.15"},{"name":"Zowe Desktop Eclipse Orion-based React Editor","repository":"orion-editor-component","version":"0.0.9"},{"name":"Zowe Desktop JES UI Plugin","repository":"explorer-jes","version":"0.0.21"},{"name":"Zowe Desktop Web Plug-in Server","repository":"explorer-ui-server","version":"0.2.8"},{"name":"Zowe Desktop z/OS Unix Files UI Plugin","repository":"explorer-uss","version":"0.0.13"},{"name":"Zowe Explorer Common REST Server","repository":"explorer-api-common","version":"0.3.2"},{"name":"Zowe Explorer Data Sets REST Server","repository":"data-sets","version":"0.2.2"},{"name":"Zowe Explorer Jobs REST Server","repository":"jobs","version":"0.2.4"},{"name":"zosmf-auth(Zowe Application Framework Authentication Handlers)","repository":"zosmf-auth","version":"1.3.0"},{"name":"Zowe Desktop TN3270 Emulator Plug-in","repository":"tn3270-ng2","version":"1.3.0"},{"name":"Zowe Desktop Sample Angular Application","repository":"sample-angular-app","version":"1.3.0"},{"name":"Zowe Desktop Sample iFrame Application","repository":"sample-iframe-app","version":"1.3.0"},{"name":"Zowe Desktop Sample React Application","repository":"sample-react-app","version":"1.3.0"},{"name":"Zowe Desktop VT Emulator Plugin-in","repository":"vt-ng2","version":"1.3.0"},{"name":"Zowe Desktop Editor Plugin-in","repository":"zlux-editor","version":"1.3.0"},{"name":"Zowe Desktop Workflows Plugin-in","repository":"zlux-workflow","version":"1.3.0"}],"releaseDate":"2019-06-28T18:00:13Z"}
